# Memory-Game
 Simple and dynamic memory game

 In each turn, one of the closed cards is selected by the player and flipped over, attempting to match cards with the same number. 
 As part of the project, numbers are listed in the area of the user's choice (e.g., 4x4, 6x6, 8x8, etc.). When a card is flipped open, 
 it remains open until a second card is selected. When the second card is opened and the images do not match, 
 both cards are turned back to the closed position after a few seconds of waiting. If the match is correct, these cards remain open throughout the game. 
 The user can save the game at any time, exit, and continue from where they left off later.
